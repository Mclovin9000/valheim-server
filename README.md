# valheim-server
Project for managing a valheim server in the cloud in a resource-efficient way.
Will be composed of two pieces:
1. Docker container which launches a valheim server
2. Front-end from which the server can be controlled. Will need to spin it up and shut it down so that resources aren't being wasted when no on is playing.
